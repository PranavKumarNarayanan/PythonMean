# Python Mean
Python Program to find mean of Grouped Data
This is a simple Python Program to find the Mean of Grouped data, with class intervals and Frequency.
<br>Program Flow: <br>
The program first collects the class intervals as "Upper Limit" and "Lower Limit" and frequence as many times as defined by the user.<br>
Then these datas are appended to a list.<br>
Then it finds the summation of the Class mark, the frequency, and finds the mean by, mean-sig_fixi/sig_fi<br>
Please support my code if you like it<br>
Thanks!
